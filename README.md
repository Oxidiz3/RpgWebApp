# RpgWebApp
I created RpgWebApp to learn more about web apis, and to understand the difference between GET and POST
This app will allow you to create a character using some basic stats and then stores them in a database.

**To Run**
In the first mysite folder run "python manage.py runserver"

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Web Pages

* I created a character creation page
* I created a page to help you view your character stats.

# Development Environment

# Useful Website
* [Django docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/intro/tutorial02/#activating-models)
